echo.
echo This tries to start 'Git Bash' (if you have it installed) from current dir.
echo You can then run .sh scripts in the newly opened window, like for example:
echo   ./setup.sh
echo   ./setup.sh clean-all
echo   exit
echo Note: for cleanup operations, it's strongly recommended to first close ALL IntelliJ windows, before continuing with the sh scripts!
